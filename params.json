{"name":"Pi-MFD","tagline":"A Multi-Function Display application framework for use with Raspberry Pi and intended to be integrated with hardware buttons.","body":"# Pi-MFD\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis project is an attempt to build a Python-based dashboard application that works with a 7 inch Raspberry Pi display. \r\nThis came out of a desire to tinker with Raspberry Pi, learn Python and become more exposed to Unix and Physical computing.\r\n\r\n## Current Status\r\nThe application is essentially a loose collection of partially implemented modules with a simple navigation capability using the F1-F5 and F8-F12 keys. It's not useable except as a clock.\r\n\r\n## Deployment Target\r\nThe intended deployment target of this software during development is a ThermalTake Core V1 mini-atx case hosting a \r\nRaspberry Pi B+ running Raspbian and outputting on a 7 inch external display. The display is augmented with 5 hardware\r\nbuttons mounted above and below the case.\r\n\r\n### Compatible Platforms\r\n\r\nPi MFD has been tested in its current state on the following platforms: Windows 8 x64, Windows 10 x86, Rasbian, Ubuntu\r\n\r\n## Development Disclaimer\r\nThis code is still very early under development and is not intended for external use and does not represent working software.\r\n\r\nAn additional note: I have no prior experience with the python language.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis code is available under the GNU General Public License. See LICENSE for more information. \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nPi-MFD requires:\r\n* Python 2.7 or higher \r\n* A version of pygame compatible with the installed version of Python.\r\n\r\n## User Interface\r\n\r\n### Principles\r\nPi-MFD intentionally goes for a toned down military / console style of user interface inspired somewhat by avionics\r\ndisplays found on modern aircraft. The application should feel as a whole like a ruggedized / spartan dashboard application.\r\n\r\nEase of learning should intentionally not be a prime concern.\r\n\r\n### Top Row\r\nThe top row relates to the current application or application silo and allows users to change contexts.\r\n\r\n### Bottom Row\r\nThe bottom row relates to pages inside the current application stack.\r\nPressing on a page when it is already selected will allow the user to \r\n\r\n### Number Pad\r\nThe number pad allows for interaction with the current page, including navigating up, down, left, right, and selecting items.\r\nThe keypad will not allow users to select items on the top or bottom row.\r\n    \r\n## Features\r\nPi-MFD is planned to integrate several disparate application modules and display dashboard information for each module.\r\n\r\nPlanned applications and their pages are listed as follows:\r\n\r\n### Scheduling (SCH)\r\n#### Tasks (TASK) - Planned\r\n#### Mail (MAIL) - Planned\r\n#### Calendar (CAL) - Planned\r\n#### Weather (WTHR) - Planned\r\n\r\n### Navigation (NAV)\r\n#### Map (MAP) - Planned\r\n#### Gas (GAS) - Planned\r\n#### Food (FOOD) - Planned\r\n#### Traffic (TRAF) - Planned\r\n#### Weather Conditions (COND) - Planned\r\n\r\n### Social (SOC)\r\n#### News (NEWS) - Planned\r\n#### Facebook (FACE) - Planned\r\n#### Twitter (TWTR) - Planned\r\n#### Feedly (RSS) - Planned\r\n#### Browser (WEB) - Planned\r\n\r\n### Media (MED)\r\n#### Images (IMG) - Planned\r\n#### Pandora (PAND) - Planned\r\n#### YouTube (TUBE) - Planned\r\n#### Netflix (FLIX) - Planned\r\n#### Amazon Instant Watch (AZIW) - Planned\r\n\r\n### System (SYS)\r\n\r\n#### System Time (TIME) - Done\r\nDisplays the current time in system and GMT time.\r\n\r\n#### Performance (PERF)  - Planned\r\n#### Network (NET) - Planned\r\n#### Options (OPTS) - Planned\r\n#### Exit (EXIT) - Planned\r\nExits the application\r\n\r\n## Future Integrations\r\n\r\nPi-MFD is currently planned to expand to allow handling of GPIO devices as button handlers and to allow for deployment to Android.\r\n\r\nHardware buttons are currently simulated as F1-F5 for top row buttons and F8-F12 for bottom row buttons. F6 and F7 are reserved for future expansion.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
