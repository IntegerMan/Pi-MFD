# Pi-MFD

# Overview
This project is an attempt to build a Python-based dashboard application that works with a 7 inch Raspberry Pi display. 
This came out of a desire to tinker with Raspberry Pi, learn Python and become more exposed to Unix and Physical computing.

# Deployment Target
The intended deployment target of this software during development is a Thermaltake Core V1 mini-atx case with a 7 inch
external display with 5 hardware buttons mounted above and below the case.

# Development Disclaimer
This code is still very early under development and is not intended for external use and does not represent working software.

An additional note: I have no prior experience with the python language.

# Requirements
Pi-MFD requires Python 2.7 or higher and a version of pygame compatible with the installed version of Python.
